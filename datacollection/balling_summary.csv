Ervine ran down looking for a release shot over mid-on but was beaten by the lack of turn on the inside edge. Sharp work from Tucker, whose view of the ball was blocked until very late in the day. 37/39.6 to SC Williams, brilliant relay catch from Adair and Tector! This is stunning work. The third umpire will check it, and it's clean. Williams went again with the slog-sweep but got even less of it this time, top-edging high into the cold night sky. Adair ran around from long-on to get underneath it and was aware of the fact his left food was incredibly close to the rope. In one movement, he caught the ball then flicked it up to Tector, running around from midwicket, who took it the relay chance and immediately pointed at Adair to give him full credit for a superb piece of fielding. 79/4See all photos","5.3 to CR Ervine, skips down, swings at thin air, and Tucker does the rest!

253,New Zealand VS Australia,Australia,"1.1 to DA Warner, Strikes first ball! Oh, dear that's so unlucky. Short of a good length around the leg stump. He looks to swipe that away and gets a thick inside-edge onto his thigh pad. The ball then lobs up, hits the back of his bat and goes onto dislodge the bails. Warner is filthy with himself. Throws his head back but New Zealand are not going to mind one bit! . 5/14.5 to MR Marsh, Into the night sky, and Neesham takes a brilliant catch! Australia are crumbling. Another slower off-cutter from Southee outside off. Marsh looks to go straighter but is a touch early into the shot which causes him to drag it towards deep midwicket. Neesham steadies himself, and despite losing the ball in the lights catches it safely. 34/317.1 to PJ Cummins, Conway settles under this skier. Quite fittingly, he helps NZ seal the deal. NZ end their hoodoo in Australia. Possibly another cutter from Southee outside off, on a length. Cummins has a roundhouse swipe at it and can only top-edge it into the big gloves of Conway. 111/10 Previous NextSee all photos","1.1 to DA Warner, Strikes first ball! Oh, dear that's so unlucky.

267,Afghanistan VS England,Afghanistan,"11.1 to Ibrahim Zadran, that is chipped, and is nabbed by Moeen running backwards at extra cover! He had to turn around, and keep his eyes on the ball, which was lobbed very high under the distracting floodlights. It was a cutter from Curran, bowled on a good length on leg. Zadran lofted with the full face of the bat, but mistimed it for a catch which Moeen made look easy in the end, as the ball dropped over his right shoulder. 62/317.5 to Azmatullah Omarzai, an easy catch at deep midwicket! Ah, they are getting some comfortable ones too. Curran went short and on leg stump, as Azmat got his front leg out of the way to have a free swing, but could only find Stokes, who was stationed a good few yards inside the boundary. Again, the longer boundary comes into play. 109/617.6 to Rashid Khan, now taken at fine leg! Curran is now on a hat-trick! Yet again he went short and on leg, as Rashid went pulling almost after taking his eyes off the ball. The ball rushed on to him off the pitch, and took off from the top edge of his bat to fine leg, where Hales had no problem. 109/719.2 to Usman Ghani, a desperate hack to deep backward point! Some catching practice now, as Livingstone doesn't have to move an inch. Curran went short this time, after bowling a yorker last ball. Got it to angle outside off, as Ghani had a swat at that, only to gift a catch with a flat hit. 112/919.4 to Fazalhaq Farooqi, yeah, Curran becomes the first England men's bowler to take a T20I five-for! Curran went for the yorker length ball yet again, and got that just outside off. Farooqi opened the bat face, and ended up slicing it to Malan at backward point. Malan had to go low and grab that, and he did that perfectly to round off Afghanistan's collapse, and give Curran his fifth. 112/10","11.1 to Ibrahim Zadran, that is chipped, and is nabbed by Moeen running backwards at extra cover! He had to turn around, and keep his eyes on the ball, which was lobbed very high under the distracting floodlights. It was a cutter from Curran, bowled on a good length on leg. Zadran lofted with the full face of the bat, but mistimed it for a catch which Moeen made look easy in the end, as the ball dropped over his right shoulder. 62/317.5 to Azmatullah Omarzai, an easy catch at deep midwicket! Ah, they are getting some comfortable ones too. Curran went short and on leg stump, as Azmat got his front leg out of the way to have a free swing, but could only find Stokes, who was stationed a good few yards inside the boundary. Again, the longer boundary comes into play. 109/617.6 to Rashid Khan, now taken at fine leg! Curran is now on a hat-trick!

306,Pakistan VS India,Pakistan,"13.2 to Shadab Khan, hits a hard length, angling in towards off stump, and Shadab looks to take it on. Clears his front leg to slog over the on side, but it's a hard thing to do against this sort of length. Goes with a diagonal bat, slices it a little, and only succeeds in launching it straight to long-on. 96/413.6 to Haider Ali, and again, the hard length proves extremely difficult to go after. Angling into middle and leg, so there's very little room to work with either. Clears his front leg, goes hard with that diagonal bat, and hits it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. 98/515.5 to Mohammad Nawaz, gone, Hardik gets his third. Knows Nawaz is looking to create room, and bowls a short-of-length ball at his body. Actually straightens into him even as he backs away, and bounces a little extra. Tries to run it down past short third, who has just moved into the circle, and the extra bounce ensures he only manages to glove it to the keeper. 115/6See all photos","13.2 to Shadab Khan, hits a hard length, angling in towards off stump, and Shadab looks to take it on.

Stubbs had made room early and was already prepared to get into that ball, as he heaved that across the line. Litton at deep midwicket didn't have to move, as Stubbs' short stay came to an end. 180/318.3 to RR Rossouw, taken at cover! Shakib again went wide of off to not give Rossouw the room, and the good length ball didn't do the batter much favours either.

This was full outside off, and he looks to swipe this across the line. Only manages a gentle under edge through to the keeper. Big loss this for Bangladesh, as he was looking in good nick.. 26/12.4 to Najmul Hossain Shanto, Cleans him up! And both openers have been sent packing. This was a 148kph length ball, arrowing in towards middle. Shanto looks to swipe across the line, but misses it completely.. 27/24.4 to Shakib Al Hasan, And Nortje has another! And it's the big one of Shakib. This was full on middle and Shakib looks to clip it onside, but is struck plumb on the front pad. Shakib thought about reviewing it, as it might have pitched outside leg. But in the end decides against it.. 39/316.3 to Taskin Ahmed, the leg stump is disturbed! Once again he backed away early, and Nortje went on a back of a length. And once again, the ball shaped back into the left-hander.

He made the mistake of looking to pull him off the front foot. Arshdeep did superbly well to dig it in and get that to zip off the pitch. This has been an excellent over from him.. 101/817.6 to FJ Klaassen, comes from around the wicket and floors Klaasen with another rip roaring yorker that strikes him on the pad. Big appeal from Arshdeep, but this isn't given. India review Replays confirm this was definitely a lot closer than it appeared in real time. The umpire wasn't convinced, Arshdeep definitely was. India eventually took the review literally at the last second. Ball tracking comes back to show this would've crashed into leg stump.

Big breakthrough for SA, as Ngidi scampers across the square to his right and pouches the catch safely. Well-directed short ball and it just got too big, came off the splice of Rohit's bat and went nowhere. 23/14.6 to KL Rahul, nicked to slip! Wild west bounce does it again! This just takes off in the channel as Rahul looks for the glide to third, and a big fat edge flies into Markram's bread basket. Two in the over, Ngidi bang on it from the outset.

Bouncer does the trick once again, climbing above the eyeline as Kohli take on the pull. The ball goes high, high and spiralling towards fine leg, but Rabada is there, coolest man in the house, making the catch look simple as he runs around the boundary, silencing the crowd in the process. 41/38.3 to HH Pandya, Rabaadaaaaaaa! Superbly taken at fine leg! Ngidi has four. FOUR!! Another short ball, another pull shot, another India batter brings about their own downfall. Pandya won't be receiving quite so much criticism, though, as he connected well and did his best to roll the wrists. But it isn't enough in this case, as Rabada comes screaming in off the rope and pulls off a full-length dive.

Did wonderfully well to run in towards the ball from deep midwicket to complete the catch. Afif looks to slog this across the line but Arshdeep's hard length and extra bounce means he ends up hitting it off the slice. Well-judged catch by Surya running in from the deep.. 99/311.5 to Shakib Al Hasan, that's the end of Shakib, and I must say that's a superb catch from substitute Deepak Hooda at deep midwicket. Shakib looks to clear the shortest boundary on the leg side by swinging with all his might but doesn't get this off the sweet spot, Hooda comes in from the ropes, settles underneath and takes the swirler quite comfortably in the end.

627,Pakistan VS South Africa,Pakistan,"5.2 to Babar Azam, Rabada has been a gem in the field this tourney and takes a brilliant skier running back from the circle at midwicket. Babar is finally put out of his misery with another slower ball landing on a good length on fourth stump. He struggles to keep the hands back on a heave for the leg side and skies this over midwicket and mid-on.

629,Pakistan VS South Africa,Pakistan,"4.4 to Mohammad Haris, fullish length on the border between fourth stump and off stump, Haris shuffles way across his stumps to whip through midwicket on a 146 kph delivery and misses. Big lbw shout upheld. Haris reviews it. Live, I thought he was clearly outside the line of off stump. But this is an excellent decision. Ball-tracking shows he was in line with off stump on contact and the ball was ripping out the top of middle and off with three reds lighting up. Haris goes for a wildly entertaining 28 off 11.. 38/26.3 to Shan Masood, fullish length slower ball from Nortje on off stump, Masood pushes too hard at this 132 kph delivery with his hands way out in front of his body expecting the ball to come through quicker at 150 kph and the ball lobs up gently to Bavuma at mid-off who takes a thigh high catch.. 43/418.5 to Shadab Khan, launched leg side... and taken this time! There ends an innings of mighty booshing from Shadab. Short ball and he went aerial again, this one well held at deep midwicket by Stubbs as he fell backwards. But we've seen some brilliant death hitting from Shadab. 177/618.6 to Mohammad Wasim, dug in, top-edged swipe, gone! Nortje was circling but Bavuma swoops in from mid-off to complete the job. Two in two balls for Nortje - and, just as importantly at this stage, back-to-back dots. 177/7See all photos","4.4 to Mohammad Haris, fullish length on the border between fourth stump and off stump, Haris shuffles way across his stumps to whip through midwicket on a 146 kph delivery and misses.

658,New Zealand VS Ireland,Ireland,"8.1 to A Balbirnie, chopped on! He was standing on leg stump, and wanted to cut away at that. The ball was short just outside off, and tossed up too. It turned away from the batter, who played away from his body while trying to reach out, but was perhaps by the slowness of the ball. Got a bottom edge, and the middle-and-leg bail was clipped. 68/110.3 to HT Tector, Top-class bowling from Santner, it really is! Wide of the crease, loops it up outside off, seeing the batter move across. He has to force all the ball as he looks to loft it over covers, gets a thick outside edge and Southee at point completes a simple catch sliding forward.. 73/3See all photos","8.1 to A Balbirnie, chopped on!

666,Australia VS Afghanistan,Australia,"5.2 to DA Warner, calamity for Warner, bowled by the offcutter attempting a switch hit! Two men out on the leg side, so Warner switched his stance while Naveen was in his delivery stride, looking to access the other side as a right-hander. But Naveen was watching closely and went for the change-up, holding his line and beating Warner's defensive push to crash into what has become his off stump. 48/25.6 to SPD Smith, struck on the pad, up goes the finger! Smith opts to review after a discussion with Marsh. Angling in from wide on the crease, Smith was standing tall looking to whip through the leg side with a roll of the wrists but the ball struck him just above the knee roll. No bat involved, and it's smashing into the top of leg stump on ball tracking. Langton Rusere's initial decision is upheld, and Australia have lost three in the powerplay!. 52/318.2 to PJ Cummins, holes out to deep point! Superbly held by Rashid on the slide, running in off the rope. In fact, he almost took it above his head while horizontal on the ground!

Typical Hazlewood line and length, Ghani rocked back looking to club over the leg side but miscued it straight up in the air. There was some miscommunication as Cummins and Warner both found themselves underneath it. Warner left it for Cummins, racing in from mid-on, and he did well to cling onto it. 15/114.3 to Mohammad Nabi, short ball, paddled to deep square leg! Nabi's hit it too well, just an uppish flick and it sails down the throat of Warner running in. Afghanistan have lost 4 for 4 in nine balls, and their World Cup looks set to end on a whimper. For Australia, there are still a few NRR crumbs on the table. 103/6See all photos","2.3 to Usman Ghani, tumbling catch by Cummins off a skier!

This was a fullish length ball on middle stump that may have held in the pitch a touch but the shot was not confident at all.

711,Netherlands VS South Africa,South Africa,"2.4 to Q de Kock, got him! QDK advances down the pitch but then has to reach out to slash this length ball outside off, gets a healthy edge and Edwards accepts the simple offering gleefully. Boy, I can hear the roar in Karachi, Lahore and Dhaka. The Netherlands fans in the crowd are pleased as punch too. Until now, Klaasen kept bowling full but this time he shortened his length a touch, just about got enough movement away to take the edge as QDK went hard at that. Good bowling that.. 21/112.3 to AK Markram, gone, excellent catch by short cover! Could this be the turning point? Markram is furious. Myburgh there went low and tumbled to his left to grab that with both hands. Good take, as he had to ensure the ball didn't fall off. Markram closed the bat face early to try and clip this good length ball on middle - which was a cutter - and ended up getting a leading edge, leaving Netherlands excited for what could be. 90/4See all photos","2.4 to Q de Kock, got him!

Glover bowls a leg-cutter on a length, it's angling in from around the stumps, so Rossouw thinks he has the angle to swing it cleanly into the leg side but because he's bowled this into the pitch, the ball bounces a tad extra, Rossouw went through and got it high on the bat and turned out to be an easy catch for the boundary rider. He literally didn't have to move an inch.. 64/315.2 to DA Miller, wow, this could be the catch of the tournament! Miller and South Africa will be miffed about that, not least because it comes from van der Merwe, a man who represented their country in the T20 World Cups in 2009 and 2010. He was placed at short fine leg, and turned around and started running the moment the ball took off Miller's top edge. Van der Merwe kept running and running with one eye on the ball, and as he went low and tumbled to his left, the ball stuck! Wow. Short delivery from Glover outside off, and pulled by Miller, but not timed at all. 112/515.4 to WD Parnell, another one gone! Netherlands supporters' voices just grow louder at the Oval. Glover is the boss. The ball was full and wide of off, as Parnell stretches out and reaches forward to try and have a feel.

Glover is the boss. The ball was full and wide of off, as Parnell stretches out and reaches forward to try and have a feel.

He was literally the lone ban marshalling that side of the outfield. Glover bowls a leg-cutter on a length, it's angling in from around the stumps, so Rossouw thinks he has the angle to swing it cleanly into the leg side but because he's bowled this into the pitch, the ball bounces a tad extra, Rossouw went through and got it high on the bat and turned out to be an easy catch for the boundary rider. He literally didn't have to move an inch.. 64/315.2 to DA Miller, wow, this could be the catch of the tournament! Miller and South Africa will be miffed about that, not least because it comes from van der Merwe, a man who represented their country in the T20 World Cups in 2009 and 2010.

But there was the longer boundary, as he found the fielder. 120/719.5 to KA Maharaj, slashes to deep point! Maharaj hobbling back symbolises the whole of South Africa's pain: they have surrendered from a winning position. A good length ball just outside off, and hacked forcefully after making room.

Was a peach, seam-up, looked like a slower one to the naked eye but it was 134 clicks. Came in and tailed away late, pitched around middle and went away. Mosaddek tried to dab it with an open face and missed it.

Slow, low full toss dipped and went past the flick. Shakib's front foot was planted and the back foot in the air as he tried to reach down and whip it. Ball's close to the bat but it's also close to the ground. Third umpire says 'no bat involved'. The impact's in line and ball's predicted to be hitting the stumps. Shakib's down over three metres. Still given! Shakib doesn't want to leave but has to! The bat was not hitting the ground, he was too far out. Folks are not sure in the Cricinfo bunker if that was the right call.

786,India VS England,India,"8.5 to RG Sharma, brilliant take from Curran in the deep! A wild launch from Rohit, no solid base on his heave through the line, a steepler to wide long-on where Curran scampers in, flings himself forward, and holds on inches from the turf! Rohit is cut short before he can build on his start!. 56/217.6 to V Kohli, Jordan strikes. Could have disappeared for four on another day. Wide-ish yorker, and Kohli meets it low down, on the full, with an open bat face. Times it nicely, but Adil Rashid dives to his right at short third and takes an excellent, low two-hander. 136/419.6 to HH Pandya, Ah. That runs away to the boundary, but Hardik is out hit-wicket. Again he's way back in his crease, converting a full ball into a length ball on off stump. Whips it with brilliant timing to find the square leg boundary, but in the process of stepping back to play that shot, he's trodden onto his stumps. 168/6 Previous NextSee all photos","8.5 to RG Sharma, brilliant take from Curran in the deep!

Nips back in off the pitch, and Rizwan, going hard with a diagonal bat, can only get his inside edge to it. 29/116.3 to Shan Masood, flicked in the air to Livingstone at midwicket! Don't play roulette with Sam Curran! Masood shimmied to leg, tempting Curran to reconsider his options, he simply bowled his best ball, shaping away on a tight off-stump line, and the lofted cross-bat clip didn't have enough on it. A simple take in the deep, and Dr Death has done the trick once more.... 121/518.3 to Mohammad Nawaz, fires in the full length, chipped to Livingstone in the deep! Curran is making his play for man of the tournament here!
